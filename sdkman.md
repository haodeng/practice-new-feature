# Usage
https://sdkman.io/usage

    sdk list java
I recommend you choose the current Long Term Support (LTS) version packaged by AdoptOpenJDK with the Hotspot JVM, e.g., 11.0.7.hs-adpt.

    sdk install java 11.0.11.j9-adpt
    
    sdk current java

Default version, all shells will use this version

    sdk default java 11.0.11.j9-adpt
 
Only the current shell use the version

    sdk use java 11.0.11.j9-adpt
